Modify the program to use the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis" target="_blank">`Twitter Streaming API`</a>

The program <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/connecting" target="_blank">connects</a>
and "listens" to Twitter, which periodically sends out a tweet to be processed.

Could have different options for listening, e.g. `keyword-based`, `user-based`, `location-based`

Collect data and store in a database

Will have to sign up for an API key and implement <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/authorizing-request" target="_blank">authorization (OAuth)</a>

This could also benefit my thoughts around polling- where a question is published
(and related to a #hashtag) and responses could be captured and measured.
